# [Frank, Ian and Glen’s Letters](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/psets/4/figlet/#frank-ian-and-glens-letters)

[FIGlet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIGlet), named after [Frank, Ian, and Glen’s letters](http://www.figlet.org/faq.html), is a program from the early 1990s for making large letters out of ordinary text, a form of [ASCII art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII_art):

```
 _ _ _          _   _     _
| (_) | _____  | |_| |__ (_)___
| | | |/ / _ \ | __| '_ \| / __|
| | |   <  __/ | |_| | | | \__ \
|_|_|_|\_\___|  \__|_| |_|_|___/

```

Among the fonts supported by FIGlet are those at [figlet.org/examples.html](http://www.figlet.org/examples.html).

FIGlet has since been ported to Python as a module called [pyfiglet](https://pypi.org/project/pyfiglet/0.7/).

In a file called `figlet.py`, implement a program that:

- Expects zero or two command-line arguments:
  - Zero if the user would like to output text in a random font.
  - Two if the user would like to output text in a specific font, in which case the first of the two should be `-f` or `--font`, and the second of the two should be the name of the font.
- Prompts the user for a `str` of text.
- Outputs that text in the desired font.

If the user provides two command-line arguments and the first is not `-f` or `--font` or the second is not the name of a font, the program should exit via `sys.exit` with an error message.
