## Disclaimer

- If you are CS50 student you are encourged not to look at solutions to the PSETS / Projects until you completed those by yourselve. the essence of all work that you submit to this course must be your own. Collaboration on problem sets is not permitted.0

- Read the [Academic Honesty](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/honesty/). While my solutions may assist you in completing the course with minimal effort, you should first try to come up with a working solution before consulting any of my suggestions. The only way to get final mastery, in my opinion, is to devote your time and energy to solving the problem sets yourself.
