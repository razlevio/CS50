## Disclaimer
- If you are CS50 student you are encourged not to look at solutions to the PSETS / Projects until you completed those by yourselve. the essence of all work that you submit to this course must be your own. Collaboration on problem sets is not permitted.0
- Read the [Academic Honesty](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/honesty/). While my solutions may assist you in completing the course with minimal effort, you should first try to come up with a working solution before consulting any of my suggestions. The only way to get final-project mastery, in my opinion, is to devote your time and energy to solving the problem sets yourself.
