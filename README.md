This repository created for hosting my Harvard University <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/">CS50</a> problem sets solutions.
 
## Course Description
Introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming. This course teaches students how to think algorithmically and solve problems efficiently. Topics include abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, software engineering, and web programming. Languages include C, Python, and SQL plus HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Problem sets inspired by the arts, humanities, social sciences, and sciences. <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/">CS50</a> katas.

## Problem Sets and Their Implementation Language

| Problem Set Number | Implementation | Subject
|--|--|--
| PSET 1 | C | Basics
| PSET 2 | C | Arrays
| PSET 3 | C | Algorithms
| PSET 4 | C | Memory
| PSET 5 | C | Data Structures
| PSET 6 | Python | Python
| PSET 7 | SQL | Query and Management
| PSET 8 | HTML, CSS, JavaScript | Web Developement
| PSET 9 | Python, SQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript | Web Developement


### Disclaimer

- If you are CS50 student you are encourged not to look at solutions to the PSETS until you completed those PSETS by yourselve. the essence of all work that you submit to this course must be your own. Collaboration on problem sets is not permitted.


### Repository Structure

There's a folder for each problem set and inside each folder there is subfolder for the actual program since every problem set may have several different programing challenges so inside each sub folder there is a problem set readme file that explains the problem set and the source code of the solution in the implementation language.
