This repository created for hosting my Harvard University <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/">CS50</a> and <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/"> Web Development </a> problem sets solutions and projects source codes.<br/><br/>

## Course Description
The intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming. This course teaches students how to think algorithmically and solve problems efficiently. Topics include abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, software engineering, and web development.
Languages include `C`, `Python`, `HTML`, `CSS`, `JavaScript`, `SQL` and `Django`. Problem sets inspired by the arts, humanities, social sciences, and sciences. <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/">CS50</a> & <a href= "https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/"> CS50 - Web Developement </a> <br/><br/>

## Disclaimer

- If you are CS50 student you are encourged not to look at solutions to the PSETS / Projects until you completed those by yourselve. the essence of all work that you submit to this course must be your own. Collaboration on problem sets is not permitted.0


- Read the [Academic Honesty](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/honesty/). While my solutions may assist you in completing the course with minimal effort, you should first try to come up with a working solution before consulting any of my suggestions. The only way to get final mastery, in my opinion, is to devote your time and energy to solving the problem sets yourself.

## Repository Structure

There's a folder for each problem set and inside each folder there is subfolder for the actual program since every problem set may have several different programing challenges so inside each sub folder there is a problem set readme file that explains the problem set and the source code of the solution in the implementation language.
